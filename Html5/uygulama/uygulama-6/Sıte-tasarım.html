        There are many ways to become part of the rowing community. As a rower, a coach, an official or a supporter. As a rower the opportunities include flat water, coastal, indoor, para as well as age group rowing including masters, university, under-23 and junior.

For those looking to develop rowing further, World Rowing has compiled a toolkit in order to (further) develop rowing in your country.
